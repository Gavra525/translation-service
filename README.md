Translation validation service
Service exposes an endpoint that could be used to validate translation requests prior to forwarding those requests to third party service

Regarding changes to be production ready, authentication of the endpoints should be added, logging, exception handling, security logging, monitoring should be improved throughout the code, environment variables/applicaiton propeties should be replaced with proper values, etc.
